## What is OpenCVE?

OpenCVE is an open-source platform that helps you monitor and manage CVEs efficiently.

It aggregates vulnerabilities from multiple sources (MITRE, NVD, RedHat, Vulnrichment...) and lets you filter, track, and organize them by vendor, product, severity, and more.

You can subscribe to products, receive alerts, analyze changes, and collaborate with your team — all through a simple and powerful interface.
